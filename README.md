# PolkaZK Verifier SDK

## Project Overview

- ZK-POLKA-SDK is a developer-first Zero-Knowledge toolkit that abstracts away the complexity of zkSNARK proof generation, trusted setup, and verifier smart contract deployment. With just one CLI command, developers can compile Circom circuits, perform Groth16 setup, and generate all necessary artifacts (wasm, r1cs, zkey, verifier.sol). A corresponding JavaScript SDK makes it possible to verify proofs on-chain with a single function call, allowing developers to embed privacy-preserving logic into their applications seamlessly.
The SDK is designed to be intuitive even for developers unfamiliar with Web3, enabling a new wave of applications powered by zero-knowledge technology.

- ZK-POLKA-SDK is built specifically for the Polkadot ecosystem and integrates tightly with PolkaVM ‚Äî a WASM-compatible smart contract execution environment for Polkadot parachains. The verifier contracts generated by the SDK are designed to deploy and run natively on PolkaVM, ensuring optimal compatibility and performance within the Polkadot and Kusama ecosystems. By streamlining zkSNARK-based privacy features, this SDK enhances the utility and accessibility of Polkadot‚Äôs privacy-preserving dApp stack.

- Our team is passionate about privacy and accessibility in Web3. We've seen how difficult it is for developers ‚Äî especially newcomers ‚Äî to use zero-knowledge proofs due to complex tooling and cryptographic knowledge requirements. We created ZK-POLKA-SDK to democratize access to this powerful technology and make Polkadot the most developer-friendly hub for zk-based applications. By building this SDK, we aim to empower builders and attract more developers to Polkadot through a seamless zk-onboarding experience.

- circuitPath: Path to the compiled circuit folder

#### Returns:
- isValid: Boolean indicating whether the proof is valid or not

## üö´ What This Project Does NOT Provide or Implement
### While the SDK is designed to make ZK development easier, there are intentional limitations to set expectations clearly:
- ‚ùå No support for Circom 2.x.x ‚Äî SDK uses Circom 0.5.6 internally.
- ‚ùå No UI tools ‚Äî there is no graphical user interface; usage is CLI or JS/TS API only.
- ‚ùå No wallet integrations ‚Äî connecting to wallets or Web3 providers must be handled separately.
- ‚ùå No frontend boilerplate ‚Äî SDK is backend-focused and does not include UI templates.
- ‚ùå No recursive proofs or plonk ‚Äî only Groth16 protocol is supported.
- ‚ùå No multi-language bindings ‚Äî SDK is built for Node.js/JavaScript environments.
- ‚ùå No Circom debugger ‚Äî writing correct circuit logic is the developer‚Äôs responsibility.
- ‚ùå No support for custom trusted setup ‚Äî uses pre-generated pot12_final.ptau by default.

### ‚ÑπÔ∏è This SDK is built for rapid prototyping, education, and integration with PolkaVM-based verifier contracts. It is ideal for developers who want to use Zero-Knowledge proofs without diving deep into ZK cryptography.

## üß© Ecosystem Fit

### üìç Where and how does your project fit into the Polkadot/Kusama ecosystem?

zk-polka-sdk introduces a powerful and developer-friendly Zero-Knowledge Proof (ZKP) abstraction layer tailored for the Polkadot ecosystem. It integrates the industry-standard Circom and SnarkJS stack to allow developers to compile circuits, generate proofs, and deploy Solidity verifier contracts directly onto PolkaVM-compatible parachains ‚Äî all with a single command or function call.

Our SDK transforms how developers engage with ZK tech in Polkadot by enabling privacy-preserving logic to be embedded in decentralized applications with zero friction.

---

### üéØ Who is your target audience?

- dApp developers building on PolkaVM or Substrate-based chains
- Parachain teams looking to enable private logic or compliance (e.g., age verification, KYC-gated access)
- Frontend and UI engineers integrating on-chain verifiers with zero-knowledge backend logic
- Hackathon builders and early-stage startups
- Ecosystem educators and researchers

---

### ‚úÖ What need(s) does your project meet?

- Provides a high-level, user-friendly SDK that wraps the low-level Circom + SnarkJS toolchain
- Simplifies complex ZK workflows (compilation ‚Üí trusted setup ‚Üí proof ‚Üí verifier ‚Üí on-chain verification)
- Eliminates the need for deep cryptographic or protocol knowledge to use ZK in production
- Enables developers to create privacy-first apps without ever writing Solidity
- Provides full compatibility with PolkaVM chains ‚Äî something most Ethereum-focused ZK SDKs cannot offer

---

### üîç How did you identify these needs?

- Real-world feedback from hackathon participants struggling to integrate Circom/SnarkJS workflows
- Developer discussions across Polkadot Forum and Substrate StackExchange emphasizing the lack of plug-and-play ZK tooling
- A comparative gap in documentation and tooling for Circom/SnarkJS in non-EVM environments
- Observed limitations of ZK projects in other ecosystems ‚Äî most are either closed, highly abstracted, or coupled tightly to their L2 protocols
- High interest in use cases like ZK-based identity, voting, and selective disclosure, but limited tooling support to implement them

---

### üß† Are there other similar projects in the Polkadot/Kusama ecosystem?

A few, but none match our SDK in usability or flexibility:

| Project           | Focus Area                              | Comparison with zk-polka-sdk                                     |
|-------------------|-------------------------------------------|------------------------------------------------------------------|
| Zcloak Network    | ZK Identity + DID                        | zk-polka-sdk is developer-centric and supports any use case      |
| Manta Network     | zk-ID and private swaps                  | zk-polka-sdk offers a modular SDK, not a fixed protocol stack    |
| Subzero (Parity)  | Experimental ZK tooling                  | zk-polka-sdk is production-ready and easier to integrate         |

Unlike these specialized protocols, zk-polka-sdk empowers developers to build their own custom ZK logic and deploy it in minutes.

---

### üÜï If not, why hasn‚Äôt a project like this existed?

- Most efforts have focused on protocol-specific solutions (like identity or credentials), not general-purpose SDKs
- Circom + SnarkJS, despite being powerful, are considered "too low level" for most developers
- Existing tools are heavily EVM-centric and incompatible with PolkaVM or require significant custom integration
- The Polkadot ecosystem lacked a bridge between powerful cryptography and general developer experience ‚Äî until now

---

### üåê Are there similar projects in other ecosystems?

Yes, but zk-polka-sdk offers significant advantages:

| Project        | Ecosystem | Limitations                                         | zk-polka-sdk Advantage                                 |
|----------------|-----------|------------------------------------------------------|--------------------------------------------------------|
| Sismo          | Ethereum  | Closed protocol for badges/credentials              | zk-polka-sdk is open, generic, and developer-controlled |
| Semaphore      | Ethereum  | Only supports anonymous signaling                   | zk-polka-sdk supports arbitrary circuit logic           |
| Aztec SDK      | Ethereum  | Requires tight coupling with Aztec L2               | zk-polka-sdk works on any chain with Solidity verifier support |
| Noir/Nargo     | ZK Stack  | Still maturing, not Circom-compatible                | zk-polka-sdk is built on battle-tested Circom + SnarkJS |

zk-polka-sdk is the first SDK to:
- Fully abstract the Circom + SnarkJS workflow
- Integrate directly with PolkaVM-based chains
- Provide a CLI and API interface usable by both frontend and backend devs
- Allow seamless deployment of Solidity verifier contracts on Polkadot-compatible infrastructure

---

üß© In summary, zk-polka-sdk empowers developers to integrate privacy-preserving zero-knowledge logic in minutes. Built on Circom + SnarkJS and customized for PolkaVM, it‚Äôs the most powerful and accessible zk integration tool in the Polkadot ecosystem ‚Äî and arguably, across all ecosystems.
